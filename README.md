## What's This For?

If you're like me and run your own servers for everything, you end up with dashboards, docs, and tools scattered across different subdomains. This page pulls it all together in one place so I (and anyone who's curious) can find what they need.

## The Design

I spend most of my time in terminals, so I wanted something that felt familiar. Dark background, monospace font, minimal clutter. The colors come from my HD logo - I've been using them forever and they just work for this kind of interface.

The whole thing is just HTML and CSS. No JavaScript frameworks, no build process, no dependencies. It loads fast and works everywhere.


## Skins/Themes

I make custom CSS skins for various tools I use. If you love this color, feel free to use them:

### Uptime Kuma Skin
**Location:** `skins/uptime-kuma/index.css`
**What it does:** A dark terminal-style theme for Uptime Kuma that uses my Ashbloom color palette. Makes my status page match the rest of my site's vibe.

To use it:
1. Copy the CSS from `skins/uptime-kuma/index.css`
2. Paste it into Uptime Kuma's custom CSS field
3. Save and refresh

**More skins coming** as I build them for other tools I use.

## Tech Stuff (If You Care)

* **HTML5** - Plain old semantic HTML
* **CSS3** - Custom everything using CSS variables
* **Flexbox/Grid** - For the layout magic
* **IBM Plex Mono** - My favorite monospace font
* **That's it** - Seriously, no frameworks or build tools

## Running It Yourself

If you want to use this as a template or just poke around:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. That's it - it's static

The images are referenced from my CDN, so you'll want to replace those with your own.
